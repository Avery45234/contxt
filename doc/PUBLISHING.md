### **Pre-Submission Checklist**

1.  **Increment Version (Final Check):** Ensure the initial `version` in `packages/contxt-extension/manifest.json` is set to `"0.1.0"`.

2.  **Create Production Build:** Run the following command from the project root.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Package for Upload:** Create a `.zip` archive of the contents of the `packages/contxt-extension/dist` directory. Name it `contxt-v0.1.0.zip`.

### **Chrome Web Store Submission Process**

1.  **Register:** Create your developer account at the URL you provided. This requires a one-time fee.

2.  **Create New Item:** In the Developer Dashboard, start a new item and upload your `contxt-v0.1.0.zip` file.

3.  **Complete Store Listing:** This is the most detailed step. You will need to provide the following assets:
    *   **Description:** A clear explanation of the extension's purpose and features.
    *   **Icon:** A 128x128 pixel version of our application icon for the store listing.
    *   **Screenshots:** At least one, but preferably several, high-quality screenshots of the extension in use.
    *   **Category:** Select an appropriate category (e.g., "Productivity" or "Search Tools").
    *   **Privacy Policy:** **This is mandatory.** You must provide a URL to a privacy policy. A simple page stating that the extension does not collect any user data is sufficient.

4.  **Submit for Review:** Once all fields are complete, submit the item. The review process will then begin.

That is the complete process. The MVP is solid and meets all of our initial requirements. We have a well-defined set of stretch goals for future iterations. This is a successful milestone.
